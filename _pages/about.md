  I love to experience and challenge new things globally. Those help me to develop myself and broaden my perspective. I had three chances to live abroad. First chance came to me when I was a kindergarten. And second chance was when I was a high school student. I attended the American international high school in Shanghai and lived there until I graduated. In high school, I could receive an American education and meet many foreigners who came from all over the world. After graduating from high school, I not only went to Sweden as an exchange student in my senior year, but also participated in various global activities. I was not afraid of new challenges. 
 
  I tried to keep experiencing the wider world. I was a member of a Dankook international student conference. Also, since I was helping run Hult Prize, the world competition for social entrepreneurs, in my University, I went to Europe to investigate how directors of European universities work on Hult Prize. In 2017 summer vacation, I participated in APYE which is an international internship in Thailand. The more I meet new people and share different ideas, the more I realize how important globalization is. Sharing ideas creates synergistic effects. I want to experience the world as much as possible. :smile:
