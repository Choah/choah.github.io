  I love to experience and challenge new things globally. Those help me to develop myself and broaden my perspective. I had three chances to live abroad. First chance came to me when I was a kindergarten. And second chance was when I was a high school student. I went to an American international high school in Shanghai and lived there until I graduated. In the high school, I could have an American education and meet many foreigners who came from all over the world. However, I wasn't satisfied with just being there. Not only I went Sweden as an exchange student, but also participated in various global activities. I wasn't afraid of new challenges. 
 
  I tried to keep experiencing the wider world. I was a member of a Dankook international student conference. Also, I looked into the conditions of Europe in order to see how directors of European universities work on Hult Prize, which is a world competition for social entrepreneurs. In 2017 summer vacation, I participated in APYE which is an international internship in Thailand. The more I meet new people and share different ideas, the more I realize how important globalization is. Sharing ideas created a synergy effect. When I was a senior in the university, I got a third chance to study aborad. I went to Sweden as an exchange student. I want to experience the world more. :smile:
